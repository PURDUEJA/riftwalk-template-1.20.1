# Riftwalk Mod Template (Minecraft 1.20.1 â€“ Fabric)

**Riftwalk** is a Minecraft mod built for version 1.20.1 using the Fabric mod loader. This template serves as the foundation for a larger mod that introduces powerful rift-themed gear, new resources in the End dimension, and teleportation mechanics.

Serves as a side project to help me gain more experience working with GIT and projects in JAVA.
